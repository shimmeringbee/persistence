## Background

Persistence is a simplistic library for storing key values about objects.

## Install

Add an import and most IDEs will `go get` automatically, if it doesn't `go build` will fetch.

```go
import "github.com/shimmeringbee/persistence"
```

## Usage

**This libraries API is unstable and should not yet be relied upon.**
